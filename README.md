# Digital Portfolio

A clean, responsive personal portfolio to showcase my hobbies / creative projects, coding work, and background info!

## Structure
- `index.html` – Landing page with featured projects..
- `data/` – JSON data you can edit without touching markup.


## Running Locally
Because modules + fetch need a server, start a simple local server:

### Python (if installed)
`python -m http.server 5173`


### Node (npx)
`npx serve .`

### VS Code Extension
Use the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live".

to be added!:
- Add dark/light toggle
- Add a dedicated project detail page template
- Add contact form (with a serverless service)
- Integrate GitHub API for latest commits
